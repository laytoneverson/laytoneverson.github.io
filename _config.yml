    I have been building web applications for over 12 years. My favorite development stack is Symfony
    and Doctrine2. I also enjoy writing applications using Zend Framework 2 and Laravel. I strive to
    write clean, stable code and always keep attention on the needs of the business. I'm a natural
    leader who gains respect by example and demonstration. I have a great attitude about my work and
    take challenges by the horns. Read below to discover my skills, experience, and projects; then use
